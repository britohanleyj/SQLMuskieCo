# SQLMuskieCo.
Semester long Database project culminating in this implementation repo

High Level Decisions
- For our code organization, our files are split up with the contributions that each teammate made. Evan worked on 2 Api's in a file called apis.py, and Lance uploaded a file with the 2 other API's. The main.py is for the database connection and the CLI


Team Member Contributions
- Julian: Worked on main.py, performed debugging on all files, modified query to use a transaction and testing
- Carter: Worked on main.py with Julian, completed documentation for all files
- Evan: Worked on the first 2 API's found in apis.py
- Lance: Worked on the last 2 API's
